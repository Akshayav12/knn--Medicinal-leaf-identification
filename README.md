# knn--Medicinal-leaf-identification
This repository implements a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) based medicinal leaf identification system using machine learning and computer vision techniques. The goal is to identify medicinal leaf based on leaf images
#  Key Features
✅ Non-Deep Learning Approach: Uses traditional ML instead of CNN  
✅ Feature-Based Classification: Extracts meaningful image features before applying KNN  
✅ Scalable & Efficient: Works well with smaller datasets and less computational power  
✅ Performance Evaluation: Uses Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score for model evaluation
# Dataset
The dataset contain segmented medicinal leaf images:https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/riteshranjansaroj/segmented-medicinal-leaf-images
